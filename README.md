# Gender-Identification
MatLab Code used to develop a gender identification module. The module generates two GMMs of MFCCs. One for males and one for females from a set of training data (TIMIT database). The test cases are then compared to these GMMs to determine the probability of a male or female speaker.

			PURPOSE OF CODE FILES

_________________________________________________________________

	- Important Files

1. CalculatePitch_GMM.m
	 - obtains male and female GMM from Training Data 
	 - Reguires YIN and DATA folders to run

2. Classifier_PITCH.m
	 - Final Pitch based Gender Classifier
	 - This requires the DATA and MATRICIES folders

3. Classifier_MFCC.m
	 - Final MFCC based Gender Classifier
	 - This requires DATA and VOICEBOX folders

4. Classifier_PITCHandMFCC.m
	 - Classification is done using both Pitch and MFCCs
	 - Slightly inpovered classification and computation preformance



	- Unimportant Files

1. CalculateAlternativeMFCC.m - Demonstares alternative code for calculateing MFCCs
2. CalculateVoiceboxMFCC.m    - Demonstrates calculationg of MFCCs using Voicebox
3. PlotPitchDistributions.m   - Plots pitch data histogram and GMM PDF
4. PlotPitchCDF.m             - Plots CDF of Pitch GMMs
5. PlotSingleMFCC.m           - Plots univariate MFCC GMM to display Seperability
6. PlotDoubleMFCC.m           - Plots bivariate MFCC GMM to display Seperability
7. ClassifierMFCC(Looped).m   - Same as Classifier_MFCC.m except loops code with 
				different number of components in mixture model
8. ClassifierMFCC(FixedGMM).m - Same as Classifier_MFCC excepts reads in saved GMMs 
				rather than caluclating them from stracth

			PURPOSE OF FOLDERS

_________________________________________________________________

1. DATA      - Contains addresses of TIMIT files for tets and training data
2. MATRICIES - Contains svaed GMMs
3. MFCC      - Code to calculate MFCCs of speech waveform
4. VOICEBOX  - Code to calculate MFCCs of speech waveform
5. YIN       - Code to calculate Pitch of speech Waveform

Note that the TIMIT database is not available on this GitHub account however changeing the addresses in the data folder allows the code to be used with any database
